###### [C++] Force disable Address Space Layout Randomization & the DEP Privilege of another program
###### Can be used to access raw addresses to resources, instead of locating the base module & using signature scanning/pointers by disabling the ASLR of the target, making all of it's addresses predetermined, which makes it easier to exploit the program
###### [Very useful for cheat development]
